There are several layers to object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript:
- Layer 1: Object-orientation with single objects (covered in “Layer 1: Single Ob‐
jects” on page 197)
- Layer 2: Prototype chains of objects (described in “Layer 2: The Prototype Rela‐
tionship Between Objects” on page 211)
- Layer 3: Constructors as factories for instances, similar to classes in other languages
(discussed in “Layer 3: Constructors—Factories for Instances” on page 231)
- Layer 4: Subclassing, creating new constructors by inheriting from existing ones
(covered in “Layer 4: Inheritance Between Constructors” on page 251)
