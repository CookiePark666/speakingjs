# Chapter 1 - Basic Javascript

## Javascript VS ECMAScript
ECMAScript is the official name for JavaScript. A new name became necessary because there is a trademark on Java 
(held originally by Sun, now by Oracle). At the moment, Mozilla is one of the few companies allowed to officially 
use the name JavaScript because it received a license long ago. For common usage, the following rules apply:

- JavaScript means the programming language.
- ECMAScript is the name used by the language specification. Therefore, whenever referring to versions of the language, 
people say ECMAScript. The current version of JavaScript is ECMAScript 5; ECMAScript 6 is currently being developed.
